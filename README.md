### The Map - Components 
To create the style layer I made adjustments to the predefined "Basic" map in MapBox.

To start I made the base colour scheme a bit more dark, kind of a relaxing autumn vibe.
I also made the Parks very green and the Waterbodies very blue so they would pop and be distinguished from the land and roads.

Since the main data is the car crashes in 2017, I decided to make the roads extra dark so they can be easily seen, I also made them a bit thicker.
